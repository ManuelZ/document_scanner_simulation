## A document scanner tested in a simulation environment

*Associated article: [Document Scanner Simulation project](https://manuelz.github.io/projects/document-scanner-simulation/)*

This project presents a document scanner application that converts images of rectangular documents into a top-down view. To test its capabilities, I developed a simulation using the Webots robotics simulator and OpenCV for image processing and classical computer vision techniques.
